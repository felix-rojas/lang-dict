This is a small project to parse an xml french dictionary file provided by L’Université Toulouse - Jean Jaurès (UT2J)
The dictionary file was created by [Franck Sajous] (sajous@univ-tlse2.fr) and is available [here] (http://redac.univ-tlse2.fr/lexiques/wiktionaryx.html) for download.

## Objective

To sort the file and its entries in different forms using basic data structures and algorithms

## Regarding the 7z file

The included 7z file is the compressed form of the xml file, which is quite large for versioning. I have decided to add only the compressed file for backup purposes as it will not change. 
With that in mind however, be careful when extracting the 7z because it is *300 MB heavy*.
